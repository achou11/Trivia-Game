"the clue is a number". to get this number, count the number of words in each line, for the first, its 5. count from the end of the line "r" and count 5 letters back. you end with "u". do the same for the rest, and you end with :  "usdrt"  the next part, is a riddle in itself. "caused through inorder currently out of order the answer lies within"  the "caused through inorder" is suggesting an anagram. the "answer lies within" means that the answer is the solved anagram.  if we solve the anagram, we come up with two results that make sense. "durst" and "turds" now think, a teenager made this riddle, it would seem strange having an answer like "durst" leaving only one possibility.  yep, you guessed it. the answer is "turds"

Ray Whitcombe is found dead in his office at his desk. The police have narrowed the suspects down to three people: Mrs. Barbara Whitcombe, Ray's wife; Mr. Jason McCubbins, Ray's business partner; and Mr. Harold Nichols, Ray's best friend. All three visited Mr. Whitcombe the day of his murder, but all three provide the police with stories of explanation as to the reason for their visit. Police found Mr. Whitcombe with his wrist watch still on his right arm, a torn up picture of his wife laying on the floor beside the trash can, and an ink pen in his right hand.  On the desk, the police found a name plate, a telephone that was off the hook, and a personal calendar turned to the July 5th page with 7B91011 written on it. After examining this evidence, the police knew their suspect. Who was it?&Jason McCubbins, Ray's business partner. The calendar is the clue to solving this murder. The police realized that since Mr. Whitcombe was wearing his watch on his right arm, he must be left handed. But the pen was found in his right hand. Realizing that the number on the calendar was written in a hurry and with his opposite hand, police matched the written number with the months of the year. So the B was an 8, thereby giving us 7-8-9-10-11: July, August, September, October, November. Use the first letter of each month and it spells J-A-S-O-N.
